  The purpose of this site is to provide information about and advocate the use of LDAP directory services.

  Unless otherwise noted, all content on this site was written by Neil Wilson. I am currently employed by Ping Identity as a Principal Engineer and lead developer for the Ping Identity Directory Server, Ping Identity Directory Proxy Server, and UnboundID LDAP SDK for Java. In the past, I have also written code for the OpenDS, Sun/Oracle DSEE, and Netscape/iPlanet Directory Server products. However, I want this to be a technical site and not a marketing one, so I want to include information about all LDAP-related products, regardless of my personal affiliations. And please note that all thoughts and opinions expressed on this site are my own and do not necessarily reflect or align with my employer.
