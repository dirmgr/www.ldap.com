  If you want to use LDAP, then chances are pretty good that you’re going to do at least one of the following three things:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Install and configure a directory server (or multiple servers configured in a replicated topology for high availability and improved performance). The <a href="https://ldap.com/directory-servers/">Directory Servers</a> page lists a number of open source and commercial directory servers that you might want to use.
  </li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>
    Write software to interact with a directory server over LDAP. The <a href="https://ldap.com/client-apis/">Client APIs</a> page provides a list of several libraries that you can use to perform LDAP communication in a variety of languages.
  </li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>
    Use software that someone else has already written to interact with a directory server. There are a lot of options here, too, and some of them are listed on the <a href="https://ldap.com/ldap-tools/">LDAP Tools</a> page.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  Also note that the LDAP.com website used to be the official home page for the UnboundID LDAP SDK for Java.  I’m still <a href="https://ldap.com/unboundid-ldap-sdk-for-java/">hosting it here</a> to ensure that old links still work, and I’ll continue to keep the copy hosted here up to date, but the official home page for the UnboundID LDAP SDK for Java is now the GitHub project home page at <a href="https://github.com/pingidentity/ldapsdk" target="_blank">https://github.com/pingidentity/ldapsdk</a>.
