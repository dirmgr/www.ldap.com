  If you want to use LDAP, then chances are pretty good that youâ€™re going to do at least one of the following three things:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Install and configure a directory server (or multiple servers configured in a replicated topology for high availability and improved performance). The <a href="https://ldap.com/directory-servers/">Directory Servers</a> page lists a number of open source and commercial directory servers that you might want to use.
  </li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>
    Write software to interact with a directory server over LDAP. The <a href="https://ldap.com/client-apis/">Client APIs</a> page provides a list of several libraries that you can use to perform LDAP communication in a variety of languages.
  </li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>
    Use software that someone else has already written to interact with a directory server. There are a lot of options here, too, and some of them are listed on the <a href="https://ldap.com/ldap-tools/">LDAP Tools</a> page.
  </li>
</ul>
