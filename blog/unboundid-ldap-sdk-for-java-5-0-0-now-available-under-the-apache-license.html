<p>
  <a href="https://github.com/pingidentity/ldapsdk" target="_blank">UnboundID LDAP SDK for Java</a> version 5.0.0 has been released. The biggest change in this release is that the LDAP SDK is now available under the terms of the <a href="https://github.com/pingidentity/ldapsdk/blob/master/LICENSE.md" target="_blank">Apache License, Version 2.0</a>, which is more permissive and more broadly compatible than the previous GPLv2, LGPLv2.1, and UnboundID LDAP SDK Free Use License options (although you can still use the LDAP SDK under those licenses if you wish).

  There are also a number of code changes in this release of the LDAP SDK, including improved support for creating connections and connection pools from definitions provided in a JSON file, improvements in support for TLS and certificates, a fix for GSSAPI authentication, logging and debugging improvements, and support for new functionality in the <a href="https://www.pingidentity.com/en/platform/directory/directory-overview.html" target="_blank">Ping Identity Directory Server</a>. I wrote about these changes in more detail on my <a href="https://nawilson.com/2020/02/27/unboundid-ldap-sdk-for-java-5-0-0-now-available-under-the-apache-license/" target="_blank">personal blog</a>.
