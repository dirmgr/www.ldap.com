  William Brown, who recently joined SUSE to work on the <a href="https://directory.fedoraproject.org/" target="_blank">389 Directory Server</a>, has written a blog post about <a href="https://fy.blackhats.net.au/blog/html/2019/01/30/using_the_latest_389_ds_on_opensuse.html" target="_blank">using the latest 389-ds on OpenSUSE</a>, including support for running in a Docker instance.  He notes that these are bleeding edge builds and aren’t production ready, but it’s a good way to get a preview of what’s coming.

  He also mentions that there’s a new <a href="http://www.port389.org/docs/389ds/howto/quickstart.html" target="_blank">quickstart guide</a> on the 389-ds website.
