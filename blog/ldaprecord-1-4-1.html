<p>
  <a href="https://ldaprecord.com/" target="_blank">LdapRecord</a> aims to provide a simple way to interact with LDAP entries using PHP. The project has just released <a href="https://github.com/DirectoryTree/LdapRecord/releases/tag/v1.4.1" target="_blank">version 1.4.1</a>, which appears to include the following changes since the 1.3.0 version that I previously reported on:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Added the ability to hide or show attributes for serialization (version 1.4.0)</li>
  <li>Convert serialized dates to an ISO 8601 format (version 1.4.0)</li>
  <li>Ensure that escaped values are properly handled as strings (version 1.4.1)</li>
  <li>Ensure that entryUUID is always requested when using OpenLDAP (version 1.4.1)</li>
</ul>
