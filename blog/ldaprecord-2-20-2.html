  <a href="https://ldaprecord.com/" target="_blank">LdapRecord</a> aims to provide a simple way to interact with LDAP entries using PHP. The project has released <a href="https://github.com/DirectoryTree/LdapRecord/releases/tag/v2.20.2" target="_blank">version 2.20.2</a>, which appears to fix an issue with the APIâ€™s use of caching.
