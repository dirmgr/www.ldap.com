  The <a href="https://www.pingidentity.com/en/platform/directory/directory-overview.html" target="_blank">Ping Identity Directory Server</a> offers a multi-update extended operation that allows you to bundle multiple write operations (which can optionally be processed as a single atomic unit) into the same request. This offers better performance and lower latency than sending the requests one after another. I wrote about it on my personal blog at <a href="https://nawilson.com/2019/02/19/the-multi-update-extended-operation-in-the-ping-identity-directory-server/" target="_blank">https://nawilson.com/2019/02/19/the-multi-update-extended-operation-in-the-ping-identity-directory-server/</a>.
