  The <a href="https://github.com/ltb-project" target="_blank">LDAP Tool Box</a> project offers a number of tools, scripts, and other niceties for working with LDAP. Today, they announced the release of <a href="https://ltb-project.org/download#packages_for_debianubuntu" target="_blank">Debian and Ubuntu packages for OpenLDAP 2.4.49</a>. See <a href="https://ldap.com/2020/01/30/openldap-2-4-49/" target="_blank">last Thursday’s post</a> for more details about what’s in the new OpenLDAP 2.4.49 release.
