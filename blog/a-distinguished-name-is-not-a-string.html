  <a href="https://twitter.com/hackuador" target="_blank">Fraser Tweedale</a> works on identity management solutions at Red Hat, focusing on X.509. He has just published a blog post titled “<a href="https://frasertweedale.github.io/blog-redhat/posts/2019-05-28-a-dn-is-not-a-string.html" target="_blank">A Distinguished Name is not a string</a>” in which he discusses distinguished names (DNs), both in LDAP and X.509 certificates. It describes what DNs are and how to avoid some of the common pitfalls that may arise from the different string representations that equivalent DNs may have.
