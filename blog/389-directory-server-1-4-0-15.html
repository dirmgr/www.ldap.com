  The <a href="http://directory.fedoraproject.org/" target="_blank">389 Directory Server</a> version 1.4.0.15 has been released.  The <a href="http://directory.fedoraproject.org/docs/389ds/releases/release-1-4-0-15.html" target="_blank">release page</a> suggests that it’s a relatively minor bugfix update, but one of them looks like it fixes incorrect memory allocation for a change introduced in the 1.4.0.14 release, so it’s probably a good idea to update to this new release if you’ve already updated to 1.4.0.14.
