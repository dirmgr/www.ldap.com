<p>
  The <a href="http://directory.fedoraproject.org/" target="_blank">389 Directory Server</a> project has released <a href="https://directory.fedoraproject.org/docs/389ds/releases/release-2-1-0.html" target="_blank">version 2.1.0</a>. The release announcement contains a long list of changes in this release, but it looks like many of them were also included in earlier 2.0.x updates, so it’s hard to tell exactly is new in this release. Also, the items listed in the release notes have short, cryptic descriptions that aren’t very meaningful on their own, and I don’t want to look them up one-by-one in their issue track to try to come up with more understandable descriptions of the changes.
