  <a href="https://github.com/Adldap2/Adldap2" target="_blank">Adldap2</a> is a PHP package that provides LDAP authentication and directory management tools. The project has just released <a href="https://github.com/Adldap2/Adldap2/releases/tag/v10.2.2" target="_blank">version 10.2.2</a>, which appears to reset the authentication status of a connection when it is established or closed, as well as adding support for custom password encoding.
