<p>
  <a href="https://github.com/pingidentity/ldapsdk" target="_blank">UnboundID LDAP SDK for Java</a> version 4.0.13 has been released. Itâ€™s a pretty minor release chose changes are primarily in support of the upcoming 8.0.0.0 release of the <a href="https://www.pingidentity.com/en/platform/directory/directory-overview.html" target="_blank">Ping Identity Directory Server</a>, but it also includes some useful debugging enhancements and improvements in its support for X.509 certificates. I wrote about the changes on <a href="https://nawilson.com/2019/11/26/unboundid-ldap-sdk-for-java-4-0-13/" target="_blank">my personal blog</a>.
