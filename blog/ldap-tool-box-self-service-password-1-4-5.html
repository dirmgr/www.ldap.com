  The <a href="https://github.com/ltb-project" target="_blank">LDAP Tool Box</a> project provides a set of LDAP-related applications, administrative tools, and other utilities.  They have just released <a href="https://github.com/ltb-project/self-service-password/releases/tag/v1.4.5" target="_blank">version 1.4.5</a> of their <a href="https://github.com/ltb-project/self-service-password" target="_blank">Self Service Password</a> tool, which is a PHP application that allows users to change their password in an LDAP directory. It appears that this release fixes an issue that could prevent it from properly authenticating to an LDAP server.
