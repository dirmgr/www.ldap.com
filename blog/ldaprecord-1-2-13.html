  <a href="https://ldaprecord.com/" target="_blank">LdapRecord</a> aims to provide a simple way to interact with LDAP entries using PHP. The project has just released <a href="https://github.com/DirectoryTree/LdapRecord/releases/tag/v1.2.13" target="_blank">version 1.2.13</a>. Changes that have been incorporated since the last 1.2.11 version that I reported on include:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Fixed caching issues (version 1.2.12)</li>
  <li>Fixed an issue in which attempting to set a single value for a multi-valued attribute might not replace the entire attribute (version 1.2.13)</li>
  <li>Fixed an issue with attempts to add non-unique values to existing attributes (version 1.2.13)</li>
</ul>
