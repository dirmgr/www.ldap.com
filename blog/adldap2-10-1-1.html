  <a href="https://github.com/Adldap2/Adldap2" target="_blank">Adldap2</a> is a PHP package that provides LDAP authentication and directory management tools. The project has just released <a href="https://github.com/Adldap2/Adldap2/releases/tag/v10.1.1" target="_blank">version 10.1.1</a>, which appears to fix an issue that could cause the library to indicate that an attribute was missing from an entry even if it was present, and changes the default pagination size from 50 entries to 1000.
