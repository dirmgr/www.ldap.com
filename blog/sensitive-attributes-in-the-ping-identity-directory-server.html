  The <a href="https://www.pingidentity.com/en/platform/directory/directory-overview.html" target="_blank">Ping Identity Directory Server</a> offers support for sensitive attributes, which can enforce strong protections for interactions with a specified set of attributes, including preventing even root users from accessing them. I wrote about sensitive attributes on my <a href="https://nawilson.com/2019/09/30/sensitive-attributes-in-the-ping-identity-directory-server/" target="_blank">personal blog</a>.
