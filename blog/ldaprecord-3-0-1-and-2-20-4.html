  <a href="https://ldaprecord.com/" target="_blank">LdapRecord</a> aims to provide a simple way to interact with LDAP entries using PHP. The project has released versions <a href="https://github.com/DirectoryTree/LdapRecord/releases/tag/v3.0.1" target="_blank">3.0.1</a> and <a href="https://github.com/DirectoryTree/LdapRecord/releases/tag/v2.20.4" target="_blank">2.20.4</a>, and it appears that the primary change in each version is to provide support for case-insensitive DN comparison.
