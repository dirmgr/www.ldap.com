  Shortly after releasing versions 1.4.0.18 and 1.3.8.9, the <a href="http://directory.fedoraproject.org/" target="_blank">389 Directory Server</a> project has released the <a href="http://directory.fedoraproject.org/docs/389ds/releases/release-1-4-0-18.html" target="_blank">1.4.0.18</a> and the <a href="http://directory.fedoraproject.org/docs/389ds/releases/release-1-3-8-10.html" target="_blank">1.3.8.10</a> versions. Both include additional protection against a possible denial of service attack, and the 1.4.0.18 release also fixes a bug that could remove replication agreements on upgrade.
