  The <a href="https://github.com/ltb-project" target="_blank">LDAP Tool Box</a> project provides a set of LDAP-related applications, administrative tools, and other utilities.  They have just released the <a href="https://github.com/ltb-project/ppm/releases/tag/v2.2" target="_blank">version 2.2</a> of their <a href="https://github.com/ltb-project/ppm" target="_blank">password policy module for OpenLDAP</a>, which is an overlay that can check the quality of passwords whenever they are changed. The primary change in this release appears to be that it is now possible to specify a maximum number of characters that passwords may have from a given character set.
