  The <a href="http://directory.fedoraproject.org/" target="_blank">389 Directory Server</a> project has released versions <a href="https://directory.fedoraproject.org/docs/389ds/releases/release-1-4-1-10.html" target="_blank">1.4.1.10</a> and <a href="https://directory.fedoraproject.org/docs/389ds/releases/release-1-4-0-31.html" target="_blank">1.4.0.31</a>. These releases appear to fix a security vulnerability that could potentially allow inappropriate access to certain attribute values (CVE-2019-14824), fix an issue in the restore task that could prevent it from reporting an error if the restore failed, add disk monitoring support, and address UI-related issues.
