  <a href="https://ldaprecord.com/" target="_blank">LdapRecord</a> aims to provide a simple way to interact with LDAP entries using PHP. The project has released <a href="https://github.com/DirectoryTree/LdapRecord/releases/tag/v2.0.4" target="_blank">version 2.0.4</a>, which appears to add the ability to attempt automatically re-establishing a connection if an existing connection becomes invalid.
