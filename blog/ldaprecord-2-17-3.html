  <a href="https://ldaprecord.com/" target="_blank">LdapRecord</a> aims to provide a simple way to interact with LDAP entries using PHP. The project has released <a href="https://github.com/DirectoryTree/LdapRecord/releases/tag/v2.17.3" target="_blank">version 2.17.3</a>, which appears to fix an issue that could prevent model events from being properly dispatched when calling createAttribute, updateAttribute, or deleteAttribute.
