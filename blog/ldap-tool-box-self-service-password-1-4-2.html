  The <a href="https://github.com/ltb-project" target="_blank">LDAP Tool Box</a> project provides a set of LDAP-related applications, administrative tools, and other utilities.  They have just released the <a href="https://github.com/ltb-project/self-service-password/releases/tag/v1.4.2" target="_blank">version 1.4.2</a> of their <a href="https://github.com/ltb-project/self-service-password" target="_blank">Self Service Password</a> tool, which is a PHP application that allows users to change their password in an LDAP directory. This is a bugfix release that appears to fix an issue with captchas and an issue in which a proposed new password could be incorrectly rejected when using SMS-based password reset.
