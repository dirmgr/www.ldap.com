  <a href="https://ldaprecord.com/" target="_blank">LdapRecord</a> aims to provide a simple way to interact with LDAP entries using PHP. The project has just released <a href="https://github.com/DirectoryTree/LdapRecord/releases/tag/v1.4.3" target="_blank">version 1.4.3</a>, which appears to include the following changes since the 1.4.1 version that I previously reported on:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Ignore values that cannot be converted to dates when performing JSON serialization (version 1.4.2)</li>
  <li>Properly escape DNs in HasMany relation queries (version 1.4.2)</li>
  <li>Query recursive model relations when other model objects are included (version 1.4.3)</li>
</ul>
