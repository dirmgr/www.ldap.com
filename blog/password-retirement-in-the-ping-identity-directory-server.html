  The <a href="https://www.pingidentity.com/en/platform/directory/directory-overview.html" target="_blank">Ping Identity Directory Server</a> offers a password retirement feature, which allows you to change the password for an account, but continue to use the previous password for a limited period of time. This is especially helpful for application accounts because it can help you avoid the race between changing an application accountâ€™s password and updating all instances of that application with the new credentials. I wrote about it on my personal blog at <a href="https://nawilson.com/2019/03/05/password-retirement-in-the-ping-identity-directory-server/" target="_blank">https://nawilson.com/2019/03/05/password-retirement-in-the-ping-identity-directory-server/</a>.
