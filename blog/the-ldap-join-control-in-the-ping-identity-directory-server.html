  The <a href="https://www.pingidentity.com/en/platform/directory/directory-overview.html" target="_blank">Ping Identity Directory Server</a> offers an LDAP join control that allows you to request that the server return other “related” entries along with the entries that match the search criteria. I wrote about it on my personal blog at <a href="https://nawilson.com/2019/02/14/the-ldap-join-control-in-the-ping-identity-directory-server/" target="_blank">https://nawilson.com/2019/02/14/the-ldap-join-control-in-the-ping-identity-directory-server/</a>.
