  <a href="https://ldaprecord.com/" target="_blank">LdapRecord</a> aims to provide a simple way to interact with LDAP entries using PHP. The project has released <a href="https://github.com/DirectoryTree/LdapRecord/releases/tag/v2.1.3" target="_blank">version 2.1.3</a>, which appears to fix an issue that could cause it to send a modify DN request in which the new DN for the target entry would be the same as its current DN.
