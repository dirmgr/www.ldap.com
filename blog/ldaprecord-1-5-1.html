  <a href="https://ldaprecord.com/" target="_blank">LdapRecord</a> aims to provide a simple way to interact with LDAP entries using PHP. The project has just released <a href="https://github.com/DirectoryTree/LdapRecord/releases/tag/v1.5.1" target="_blank">version 1.5.1</a>, which appears to include the following changes since the 1.4.3 version that I previously reported on:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Added connection timeout management (version 1.5.0)</li>
  <li>Support failover to alternate servers when trying to establish a connection (version 1.5.0)</li>
  <li>Fixed an issue affecting paginated search processing and added a method to allow customizing the page size (version 1.5.0)</li>
  <li>Properly create OpenLDAP organizationalUnit RDNs (version 1.5.1)</li>
  <li>Donâ€™t allow setting empty LDAP option values (version 1.5.1)</li>
</ul>
