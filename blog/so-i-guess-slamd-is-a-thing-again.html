  Once upon a time, SLAMD was a pretty great tool for benchmarking and stress testing LDAP directory servers. But it was really starting to show its age and there were a lot of reasons that it kind of faded away. But people kept using it, and people kept asking questions about it, so Iâ€™ve decided to resurrect it. I wrote about it on my personal blog at <a href="https://nawilson.com/2019/03/18/so-i-guess-slamd-is-a-thing-again/" target="_blank">https://nawilson.com/2019/03/18/so-i-guess-slamd-is-a-thing-again/</a>.
