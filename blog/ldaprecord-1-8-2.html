  <a href="https://ldaprecord.com/" target="_blank">LdapRecord</a> aims to provide a simple way to interact with LDAP entries using PHP. The project has just released <a href="https://github.com/DirectoryTree/LdapRecord/releases/tag/v1.8.2" target="_blank">version 1.8.2</a>, which appears to include the following changes since the 1.8.0 version that I previously reported on:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Fixes an issue with conflicting variable names in a relation method</li>
  <li>Fixes an issue that could arise when searching for a user when the search included credentials</li>
</ul>
