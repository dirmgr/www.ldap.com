  The <a href="https://github.com/ltb-project" target="_blank">LDAP Tool Box</a> project provides a set of LDAP-related applications, administrative tools, and other utilities. They have just released <a href="https://github.com/ltb-project/slapd-cli/releases/tag/v3.2" target="_blank">version 3.2</a> of their <a href="https://github.com/ltb-project/slapd-cli" target="_blank">slapd-cli</a> tools (formerly called openldap-initscript), which provide a set of command-line tools for OpenLDAP. The primary change in this release appears to be a fix to an issue in the check_sync tool in which it could not handle a base64-encoded olcsyncrepl attribute.
