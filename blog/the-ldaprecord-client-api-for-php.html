  I have updated the <a href="https://ldap.com/client-apis/" target="_blank">Client APIs</a> page to add <a href="https://ldaprecord.com/" target="_blank">LdapRecord</a> to the list of client APIs available for PHP. I’m not very familiar with PHP, and I haven’t taken a very deep dive into the capabilities of the library, but it appears to offer a pretty straightforward way to interact with LDAP entries in a PHP application.
