  The French-language Linux site <a href="https://www.microlinux.fr/" target="_blank">Microlinux</a> has written a new blog post about <a href="https://www.microlinux.fr/389-ds-centos-7/" target="_blank">installing 389 Directory Server on CentOS 7</a>. In a <a href="https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/389-users@lists.fedoraproject.org/thread/OU2E2N6EHDEGIYOVR26RA2L6LC67RQVC/" target="_blank">message sent to the 389-users mailing list</a>, author Nicolas Kovacs suggests that this is the first post in a series he intends to write, so you might want to watch the site if you speak French and are interested in the <a href="https://directory.fedoraproject.org/" target="_blank">389 Directory Server</a>.
