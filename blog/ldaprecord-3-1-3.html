  <a href="https://ldaprecord.com/" target="_blank">LdapRecord</a> aims to provide a simple way to interact with LDAP entries using PHP. The project has released <a href="https://github.com/DirectoryTree/LdapRecord/releases/tag/v3.1.3" target="_blank">version 3.1.3</a>, which appears to fix an issue in which the presence of a diagnostic message in an operation response could cause the API to consider the operation a failure, even if the response had a successful result code.
