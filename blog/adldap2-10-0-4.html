  <a href="https://github.com/Adldap2/Adldap2" target="_blank">Adldap2</a> is a PHP package that provides LDAP authentication and directory management tools. The project has just released <a href="https://github.com/Adldap2/Adldap2/releases/tag/v10.0.4" target="_blank">version 10.0.4</a>, which fixes an issue that can interfere with authentication using a username or password with special characters.
