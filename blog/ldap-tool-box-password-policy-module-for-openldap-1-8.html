  The <a href="https://github.com/ltb-project" target="_blank">LDAP Tool Box</a> project provides a set of LDAP-related applications, administrative tools, and other utilities.  They have just released the <a href="https://github.com/ltb-project/ppm/releases/tag/v1.8" target="_blank">version 1.8</a> of their <a href="https://github.com/ltb-project/ppm" target="_blank">password policy module for OpenLDAP</a>, which is an overlay that can check the quality of passwords whenever they are changed. The main improvement in the 1.8 release is that it fixes an issue that could cause OpenLDAP to crash if checking to ensure that the password does not match a value in the entry's RDN, and it encounters an RDN with very short values.
