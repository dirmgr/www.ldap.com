  <a href="https://ldaprecord.com/" target="_blank">LdapRecord</a> aims to provide a simple way to interact with LDAP entries using PHP. The project has released <a href="https://github.com/DirectoryTree/LdapRecord/releases/tag/v2.4.3" target="_blank">version 2.4.3</a>, which fixes an issue that could prevent a page results cookie from being set and makes it easier to append custom attributes to entries.
