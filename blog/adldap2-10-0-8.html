  <a href="https://github.com/Adldap2/Adldap2" target="_blank">Adldap2</a> is a PHP package that provides LDAP authentication and directory management tools. The project has just released <a href="https://github.com/Adldap2/Adldap2/releases/tag/v10.0.8" target="_blank">version 10.0.8</a>, which fixes an issue in which it may be possible to only return a single member of a group when using a custom identifier, and also makes it easier to rename entries by omitting the new parent DN by default.
