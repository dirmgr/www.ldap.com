  <a href="https://www.pingidentity.com/en/software/pingdirectory.html" target="_blank">Ping Identity Directory Server</a> version 8.1.0.0 has just been released. This is a big release, including support for new features like composed attributes, a virtual attribute providing a JSON-formatted representation of user password policy state, alternative failure lockout actions, support for GSSAPI integrity and confidentiality, and more. I wrote about the changes in detail on my <a href="https://nawilson.com/2020/06/19/ping-identity-directory-server-8-1-0-0/" target="_blank">personal blog</a>.
