<p>
  On Monday, <a href="https://www.pingidentity.com/" target="_blank">Ping Identity</a> announced the launch of a new offering, <a href="https://www.pingidentity.com/en/cloud/pingcloud-private-tenant.html" target="_blank">PingCloud Private Tenant</a>. Although both the website landing page for the product and the associated <a href="https://www.pingidentity.com/en/company/press-releases-folder/2019/new-private-cloud-identity-solution-enterprise.html" target="_blank">press release</a> do a shockingly terrible job of describing the service, itâ€™s basically a hosted version of the <a href="https://www.pingidentity.com/en/software/pingdirectory.html">Ping Identity Directory Server</a> (and/or <a href="https://www.pingidentity.com/en/software/pingfederate.html" target="_blank">PingFederate</a>). You can get the performance, functionality, and feature set of the Directory Server without having to run it yourself (managing the hardware, OS, software, backups, security, etc.). It looks to be a similar offering to what <a href="https://jumpcloud.com/" target="_blank">JumpCloud</a> provides, but with the Ping Identity Directory Server rather than <a href="https://www.openldap.org/" target="_blank">OpenLDAP</a> or <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/srvnodes/directories" target="_blank">ActiveDirectory</a> behind the scenes.
