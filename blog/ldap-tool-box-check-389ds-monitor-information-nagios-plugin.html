  The <a href="https://github.com/ltb-project" target="_blank">LDAP Tool Box</a> project offers a number of tools, scripts, and other niceties for working with LDAP. One of the items they provide is a set of <a href="https://github.com/ltb-project/nagios-plugins" target="_blank">Nagios plugins</a> that can help monitor LDAP directory servers. Today, they <a href="https://twitter.com/LTB_Project/status/1118874113219735553" target="blank">tweeted about</a> a new <a href="https://ltb-project.org/documentation/nagios-plugins/check_ldap_monitor_389ds" target="_blank">Check 389DS cn=monitor information"</a> plugin that can look at the monitoring information that the <a href="https://directory.fedoraproject.org/" target="_blank">389 Directory Server</a> offers, including things like the number of established connections, active threads, operations processed, and entries returned by the server.
