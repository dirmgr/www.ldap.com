  <a href="https://www.isode.com/" target="_blank">Isode</a> announced <a href="https://twitter.com/Isode_Ltd/status/1116378632631586816" target="_blank">on Twitter</a> that they have released version R16.6v12 of their products, which I presume includes their <a href="https://www.isode.com/products/m-vault-directory.html" target="_blank">M-Vault LDAP/X.500 Server</a>. As with yesterday’s <a href="https://ldap.com/2019/04/10/isode-m-vault-r16-3v23/" target="_blank">R16.3v23 release</a>, the public website doesn’t seem to provide any details about what might be in this update.
