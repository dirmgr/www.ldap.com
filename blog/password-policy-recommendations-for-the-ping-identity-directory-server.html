  I wrote a post on my personal blog with some <a href="https://nawilson.com/2019/10/08/password-policy-recommendations-for-the-ping-identity-directory-server/" target="_blank">password policy recommendations for the Ping Identity Directory Server</a>. Note that while the post is specific to the <a href="https://www.pingidentity.com/en/platform/directory/directory-overview.html" target="_blank">Ping Identity Directory Server</a>, particularly with regard to some of the features and a lot of the configuration properties, much of the advice is general enough that it could be applied to other servers as well.
