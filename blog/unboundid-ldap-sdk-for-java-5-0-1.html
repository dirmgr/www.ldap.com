<p>
  <a href="https://github.com/pingidentity/ldapsdk" target="_blank">UnboundID LDAP SDK for Java</a> version 5.0.1 has been released. This is a minor release that was primarily created in service of an upcoming release of the <a href="https://www.pingidentity.com/en/platform/directory/directory-overview.html" target="_blank">Ping Identity Directory Server</a>, but it also includes a new logging API and a couple of cosmetic updates. I wrote about these changes in more detail on my <a href="https://nawilson.com/2020/03/16/unboundid-ldap-sdk-for-java-5-0-1/" target="_blank">personal blog</a>.
