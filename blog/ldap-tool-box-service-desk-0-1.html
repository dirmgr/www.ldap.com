  The <a href="https://github.com/ltb-project" target="_blank">LDAP Tool Box</a> project provides a set of LDAP-related applications, administrative tools, and other utilities. They have just announced a new <a href="https://service-desk.readthedocs.io/en/latest/" target="_blank">Service Desk</a> tool, which is a web application for administrators that supports viewing and managing accounts in an LDAP directory server. According to the announcement for the <a href="https://github.com/ltb-project/service-desk/releases/tag/v0.1" target="_blank">0.1 release</a>, this includes the following functionality:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Displaying entry attributes and account status</li>
  <li>Verifying a user’s current password</li>
  <li>Updating a user’s password and setting a flag to require a password reset</li>
  <li>Unlocking an account</li>
  <li>Indicating whether an account’s password is expired</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Note that since some of these operations are not standardized, it’s likely the case that they are only available for certain types of directory servers.
