  Although there does not yet seem to be an official announcement on the mailing list, the <a href="https://directory.apache.org/" target="_blank">Apache Directory Project</a> website lists a new 2.1.3 release of the <a href="https://directory.apache.org/api/" target="_blank">Apache Directory LDAP API</a>. The most significant changes in this release appear to include:

<ul>
  <li>Fixed an issue in which password exceptions may not include the diagnostic message returned by the server</li>
  <li>Fixed an issue that could affect comparing multivalued RDNs</li>
  <li>Changed the type of exception thrown in response to a malformed search filter string</li>
  <li>Improved DN parsing performance</li>
  <li>Updated the schema information to include attribute types from the latest revision of the password policy draft</li>
  <li>Changed the log level for a debug log message that could be generated if the API receives a response to a request that the client is no longer interested in</li>
</ul>
