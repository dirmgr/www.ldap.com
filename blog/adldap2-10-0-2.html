  <a href="https://github.com/Adldap2/Adldap2" target="_blank">Adldap2</a> is a PHP package that provides LDAP authentication and directory management tools. The project has just released <a href="https://github.com/Adldap2/Adldap2/releases/tag/v10.0.2" target="_blank">version 10.0.2</a>, which seems to ensure that connections are named, and that the name appears in the log.
