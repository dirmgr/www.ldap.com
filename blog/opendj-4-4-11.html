  The <a href="https://github.com/OpenIdentityPlatform" target="_blank">Open Identity Platform</a> project has released <a href="https://github.com/OpenIdentityPlatform/OpenDJ/releases/tag/4.4.11" target="_blank">version 4.4.11</a> of the <a href="https://github.com/OpenIdentityPlatform/OpenDJ" target="_blank">OpenDJ Directory Server</a>. As far as I can tell, the only changes in this release are updated versions of some of the dependencies. It does not appear that there have been any changes to the OpenDJ code itself.
