  <a href="https://github.com/Adldap2/Adldap2" target="_blank">Adldap2</a> is a PHP package that provides LDAP authentication and directory management tools. The project has just released <a href="https://github.com/Adldap2/Adldap2/releases/tag/v10.1.0" target="_blank">version 10.1.0</a>, which appears to add support for query caching, pagination, and the ability to free memory after performing a query. It also fixes an issue in which it used an incorrect default port number when trying to establish an LDAPS connection.
