  The <a href="https://www.openldap.org/" target="_blank">OpenLDAP</a> project has announced the release of versions <a href="https://lists.openldap.org/hyperkitty/list/openldap-announce@openldap.org/thread/4ZULFZ6P2CH63COGSOWSFEZEJBW2V3LB/" target="_blank">2.6.6</a> and <a href="https://lists.openldap.org/hyperkitty/list/openldap-announce@openldap.org/thread/ZQUY57KZVD6M54NL3ZSNRFBVUKJPLNMT/" target="_blank">2.5.16</a> of their LDAP directory server. This appears to be a bugfix release that fixes a couple of potentially urgent issues. Changes in this release include:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Fixed a regression that was introduced in an earlier fix around abandoned configuration changes</li>
  <li>Fixed an issue in the back-meta backend that could arise in processing a modify operation without any changes</li>
</ul>
