  Two new versions of the <a href="http://directory.fedoraproject.org/" target="_blank">389 Directory Server</a> have been released. The <a href="http://directory.fedoraproject.org/docs/389ds/releases/release-1-4-0-16.html" target="_blank">1.4.0.16 release</a> and the <a href="http://directory.fedoraproject.org/docs/389ds/releases/release-1-3-8-8.html" target="_blank">1.3.8.8 release</a> both revert changes that had previously been committed, presumably because a problem was identified with those changes. The 1.4.0.16 release also appears to update administrative interfaces to support backup, restore, import, and export.
