  <a href="https://www.isode.com/" target="_blank">Isode</a> announced <a href="https://twitter.com/Isode_Ltd/status/1115922931694080000" target="_blank">on Twitter</a> that they have released version R16.3v23 of their products, which I presume includes their <a href="https://www.isode.com/products/m-vault-directory.html" target="_blank">M-Vault LDAP/X.500 Server</a>. I canâ€™t find any mention of it on their public website, and the customer site requires a login to see anything, so I have no idea what might have changed in this release.
