  The <a href="https://www.pingidentity.com/en/platform/directory/directory-overview.html" target="_blank">Ping Identity Directory Server</a> provides support for soft delete operations, in which an entry can be hidden rather than completely removed. I wrote about this on my personal blog at <a href="https://nawilson.com/2019/02/27/soft-deletes-in-the-ping-identity-directory-server/" target="_blank">https://nawilson.com/2019/02/27/soft-deletes-in-the-ping-identity-directory-server/</a>.
