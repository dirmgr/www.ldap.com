  The <a href="https://github.com/ltb-project" target="_blank">LDAP Tool Box</a> project provides a set of LDAP-related applications, administrative tools, and other utilities.  They have just released the <a href="https://github.com/ltb-project/nagios-plugins/releases/tag/v0.7" target="_blank">version 0.7</a> of their <a href="https://github.com/ltb-project/nagios-plugins" target="_blank">Nagios Plugins</a> component, which can be used to track the health of LDAP servers in the <a href="https://www.nagios.org/" target="_blank">Nagios</a> monitoring system, some of which apply to any type of server, while others are implementation-specific.  This release appears to fix a few bugs found in their previous 0.6 release.
