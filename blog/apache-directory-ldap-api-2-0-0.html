  Although I havenâ€™t seen any official announcement, the <a href="https://directory.apache.org/api/" target="_blank">Apache Directory LDAP API website</a> suggests that version 2.0.0 of the API was released last Wednesday, November 13. It appears that the primary changes over the previous 2.0.0-AM4 build are to fix a few issues, including a problem in the handling of an unbind operation that could prevent a connection from being reused, improper parsing of a DN with a hex-encoded RDN value, and an issue that could lead to incomplete loading of schema information.
