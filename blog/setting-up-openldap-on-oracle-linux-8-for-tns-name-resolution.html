  Sean D. Stuber has written a <a href="https://seanstuber.com/2019/12/29/setting-up-openldap-on-oracle-linux-8-for-tns-name-resolution/" target="_blank">blog post</a> on setting up <a href="https://www.openldap.org/" target="_blank">OpenLDAP</a> on Oracle Linux 8, which has removed the OpenLDAP server from its package repository. Although the post does discuss using OpenLDAP specifically for TNS name resolution in the Oracle relational database, most of it is fairly generic advice that could apply to a range of OpenLDAP installations.
