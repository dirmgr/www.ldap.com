  <a href="https://www.pingidentity.com/en/platform/directory/directory-overview.html" target="_blank">Ping Identity Directory Server</a> versions 7.2.1.1 and 7.0.1.3 have been released. These are security updates, and customers running 7.x versions are strongly encouraged to upgrade. I wrote about the security issue, and about other changes included in these releases, on my <a href="https://nawilson.com/2019/05/21/ping-identity-directory-server-versions-7-2-1-1-and-7-0-1-3/" target="_blank">personal blog</a>.
