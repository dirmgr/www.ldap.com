  <a href="https://github.com/glauth/glauth" target="_blank">GLAuth</a> is a simple LDAP server that positions itself as a lightweight alternative to OpenLDAP or Active Directory. The project has just released <a href="https://github.com/glauth/glauth/releases/tag/v2.3.0" target="_blank">version 2.3.0</a>. It appears that the primary change in this release is to rename the table used to hold information about groups from “groups” to “ldapgroups” in order to avoid a naming conflict with MySQL.
