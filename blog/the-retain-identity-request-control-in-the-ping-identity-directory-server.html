  The <a href="https://www.pingidentity.com/en/platform/directory/directory-overview.html" target="_blank">Ping Identity Directory Server</a> offers a retain identity request control that allows you to process a bind without changing the connection’s authentication/authorization identity. It’s very useful for applications that need to process a mix of bind and non-bind operations. I wrote about it on my <a href="https://nawilson.com/2019/02/04/the-retain-identity-request-control-in-the-ping-identity-directory-server/" target="_blank">personal blog</a>.
