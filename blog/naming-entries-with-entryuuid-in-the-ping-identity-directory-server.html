  The <a href="https://www.pingidentity.com/en/platform/directory/directory-overview.html" target="_blank">Ping Identity Directory Server</a> allows you to create entries that use entryUUID as the naming attribute, which not only eliminates the need to worry about modify DN operations, but also allows for better privacy and security. I wrote about this feature on my <a href="https://nawilson.com/2019/04/29/naming-entries-with-entryuuid-in-the-ping-identity-directory-server/" target="_blank">personal blog</a>.
