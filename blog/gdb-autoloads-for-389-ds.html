  <a href="https://directory.fedoraproject.org/" target="_blank">389 Directory Server</a> developer <a href="https://twitter.com/Erstejahre" target="_blank">William Brown</a> has written about some new <a href="https://fy.blackhats.net.au/blog/html/2019/04/03/gdb_autoloads_for_389_ds.html" target="_blank">GDB helper extensions for 389 DS</a> that heâ€™s created to make it easier to examine the server in the GNU debugger. While this is probably most helpful for developers of the 389 Directory Server itself, server administrators with a development background may also find them useful in troubleshooting certain classes of problems. At present, there are extensions for helping to filter out idle threads in a thread dump, examine buffered access log information that hasn't yet been written to disk, and display the contents of an entry held in memory.
