  <li>Improved the order in which the TLS cipher suite selector returns cipher suite names.</li>
  <li>Added support for a FIPS 140-2-compliant mode using the Bouncy Castle FIPS provider.</li>

  <li>Updated ldifmodify to support ignoring certain kinds of errors, like deleting an entry multiple times or modifying or renaming an entry that does not exist int the LDIF file.</li>
  <li>Added an option that can help improve performance when using the proprietary “get user resource limits” request control in directories with large numbers of dynamic groups.</li>
<ul>
