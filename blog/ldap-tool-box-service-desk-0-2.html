  The <a href="https://github.com/ltb-project" target="_blank">LDAP Tool Box</a> project provides a set of LDAP-related applications, administrative tools, and other utilities. They have just released the <a href="https://github.com/ltb-project/service-desk/releases/tag/v0.2" target="_blank">0.2 release</a> of their <a href="https://service-desk.readthedocs.io/en/latest/" target="_blank">Service Desk</a> tool, which is a web application for administrators that supports viewing and managing accounts in an LDAP directory server. This release includes the following changes:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Fixed an issue in which the password was marked as expired if the policy does not specify a maximum age</li>
  <li>Fixed an issue in which the password reset radio button might not be checked by default</li>
  <li>Added the ability to run a script after a password is modified</li>
  <li>Added the support for displaying values that represent sizes in bytes (or kilobytes, megabytes, gigabytes, or terabytes)</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Note that since some of these operations are not standardized, itâ€™s likely the case that they are only available for certain types of directory servers.
