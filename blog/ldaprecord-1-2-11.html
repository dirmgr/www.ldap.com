  <a href="https://ldaprecord.com/" target="_blank">LdapRecord</a> aims to provide a simple way to interact with LDAP entries using PHP. The project has just released <a href="https://github.com/DirectoryTree/LdapRecord/releases/tag/v1.2.11" target="_blank">version 1.2.11</a>. Changes that have been incorporated since the last 1.2.9 version that I reported on include:
