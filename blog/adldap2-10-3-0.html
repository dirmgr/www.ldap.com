  <a href="https://github.com/Adldap2/Adldap2" target="_blank">Adldap2</a> is a PHP package that provides LDAP authentication and directory management tools. The project has released <a href="https://github.com/Adldap2/Adldap2/releases/tag/v10.3.0" target="_blank">version 10.3.0</a>, which appears to fix an issue with the paged results control and changes the way that provider connections will be closed.
