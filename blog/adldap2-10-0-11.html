  <a href="https://github.com/Adldap2/Adldap2" target="_blank">Adldap2</a> is a PHP package that provides LDAP authentication and directory management tools. The project has just released <a href="https://github.com/Adldap2/Adldap2/releases/tag/v10.0.11" target="_blank">version 10.0.11</a>, which appears to add query logging, support the homePhone attribute, utility methods for dealing with DNs, and access to additional information when interacting with FreeIPA. It also improves support for StartTLS so that it will now lazily establish connections when using StartTLS and to make it easier to obtain information about errors in StartTLS processing.
