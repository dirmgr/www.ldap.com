The 1.4.0.22 version looks like it’s primarily a bugfix release, addressing problems in areas like memory management, caching, replication, LDIF export, administrative interfaces, and other areas. The 1.4.1.2 release looks like it includes all of the fixes from 1.4.0.22, plus additional fixes, additional tests, build process updates, improved internal operation logging, and tooling updates.
