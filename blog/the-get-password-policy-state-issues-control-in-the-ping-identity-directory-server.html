I wrote about it on my personal blog at <a href="https://nawilson.com/2019/02/11/the-get-password-policy-state-issues-control-in-the-ping-identity-directory-server/" target="_blank">https://nawilson.com/2019/02/11/the-get-password-policy-state-issues-control-in-the-ping-identity-directory-server/</a>
