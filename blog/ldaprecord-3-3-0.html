  <a href="https://ldaprecord.com/" target="_blank">LdapRecord</a> aims to provide a simple way to interact with LDAP entries using PHP. The project has released <a href="https://github.com/DirectoryTree/LdapRecord/releases/tag/v3.3.0" target="_blank">version 3.3.0</a>.  The primary change in this release appears to be the addition of a mechanism for applying a base DN substitution during create and rename operations.
