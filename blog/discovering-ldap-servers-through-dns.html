  If your network’s DNS servers are configured with an appropriate set of SRV records, LDAP clients can use that information to discover the available directory servers. I’ve updated the LDAP.com site to add a new page with information about creating and using these <a href="https://ldap.com/dns-srv-records-for-ldap/">DNS SRV Records for LDAP</a>.
