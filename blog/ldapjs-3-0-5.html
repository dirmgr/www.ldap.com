  <a href="https://github.com/ldapjs/node-ldapjs" target="_blank">LDAPjs</a> is a JavaScript library that provides LDAP protocol support for the Node.js environment. The project has just released <a href="https://github.com/ldapjs/node-ldapjs/releases/tag/v3.0.5" target="_blank">version 3.0.5</a>. It appears that the primary user-facing change in this release is a fix for an issue with search filters containing non-ASCII characters.
