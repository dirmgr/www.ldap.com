  <a href="https://github.com/pingidentity/ldapsdk" target="_blank">UnboundID LDAP SDK for Java</a> version 4.0.12 has been released. Itâ€™s mostly a bugfix release, with some convenience features and new support for upcoming features in the <a href="https://www.pingidentity.com/en/platform/directory/directory-overview.html" target="_blank">Ping Identity Directory Server</a>. I wrote about the changes on <a href="https://nawilson.com/2019/10/09/unboundid-ldap-sdk-for-java-4-0-12/" target="_blank">my personal blog</a>.
