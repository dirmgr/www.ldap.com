  <a href="https://ldaprecord.com/" target="_blank">LdapRecord</a> aims to provide a simple way to interact with LDAP entries using PHP. The project has released <a href="https://github.com/DirectoryTree/LdapRecord/releases/tag/v2.4.5" target="_blank">version 2.4.5</a>, which delays connection initialization until the time that the connection is established rather than when the connection object is created, which can improve performance when using php artisan commands.
