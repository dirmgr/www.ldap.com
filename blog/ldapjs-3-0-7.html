  <a href="https://github.com/ldapjs/node-ldapjs" target="_blank">LDAPjs</a> is a JavaScript library that provides LDAP protocol support for the Node.js environment. The project has just released <a href="https://github.com/ldapjs/node-ldapjs/releases/tag/v3.0.7" target="_blank">version 3.0.7</a>. It looks like the only change in this release is a fix that can prevent a server crash when attempting to process a simple bind with an empty or malformed DN.
