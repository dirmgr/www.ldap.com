  The <a href="https://github.com/ltb-project" target="_blank">LDAP Tool Box</a> project offers a number of tools, scripts, and other niceties for working with LDAP. They have released updated versions of their <a href="https://ltb-project.org/download#packages_for_red_hatcentos" target="_blank">RPMs for OpenLDAP 2.4.48</a> for CentOS 7 and 8. According to the <a href="https://lists.ltb-project.org/pipermail/ltb-announce/2020-January/000029.html" target="_blank">release announcement</a>, this update addresses an issue that appears to affect replication performance, particularly on Amazon Linux (which is based on CentOS 7), and also addresses an issue that may affect the process of migrating the configuration from slapd.conf to cn=config.
