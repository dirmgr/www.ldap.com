  <li>Fixed an issue with replace modifications for attributes containing variants with options</li>
  <li>Improved support for passwords containing characters with multiple encodings</li>
  <li>Fixed an issue that could prevent obsolete replicas from being automatically purged in certain circumstances</li>
  <li>Fixed an issue that could prevent the servers in a replication topology from being able to select the authoritative server for maintaining information in the topology registry</li>
  <li>Increased timeouts used by the dsreplication tool to reduce the chance that they would be incorrectly encountered when interacting with a large replication topology</li>

  <li>Improved access control behavior for the password policy state extended operation</li>
  <li>Fixed an issue in which subtree searches based at the server’s root DSE could omit entries from backends with base DNs subordinate to those of other backends</li>

  <li>Changed the result code used when rejecting an attempt to change a password that is within the minimum age from 49 (invalidCredentials) to 53 (unwillingToPerform)</li>
  <li>Fixed an issue that could cause the server to return multiple password validation details response controls in the response to a password modify extended request</li>
