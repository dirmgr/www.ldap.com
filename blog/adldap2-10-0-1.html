  <a href="https://github.com/Adldap2/Adldap2" target="_blank">Adldap2</a> is a PHP package that provides LDAP authentication and directory management tools. The project has just released <a href="https://github.com/Adldap2/Adldap2/releases/tag/v10.0.1" target="_blank">version 10.0.1</a>, and it looks like this change ensures that TLS errors are more visible, while some types of authentication warnings and notices may be suppressed.
