  <a href="https://ldaprecord.com/" target="_blank">LdapRecord</a> aims to provide a simple way to interact with LDAP entries using PHP. It’s a pretty new framework, and they seem to be following the “release early, release often” principle, so it looks like they release a new version any time they make a change. I’ve been hesitant to post about each new release in the past because they’ve been pretty frequent (even multiple in the same day in a couple of cases) and I don’t want to flood the site with posts about it. On the other hand, it’s not fair to not mention it at all. So I’ll try to cover them with a reasonable frequency.
