  A new <a href="https://github.com/adaptiverecognition/ldap4j" target="_blank">Ldap4j</a> project is underway that attempts to provide a non-blocking LDAP client API for Java. At present, it only appears to support bind, search, StartTLS, and unbind operations, although I assume they also intend to add support for other types of operations.
