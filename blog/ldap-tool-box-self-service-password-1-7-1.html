  The <a href="https://github.com/ltb-project" target="_blank">LDAP Tool Box</a> project provides a set of LDAP-related applications, administrative tools, and other utilities.  They have just released <a href="https://github.com/ltb-project/self-service-password/releases/tag/v1.7.1" target="_blank">version 1.7.1</a> of their <a href="https://github.com/ltb-project/self-service-password" target="_blank">Self Service Password</a> tool, which is a PHP application that allows users to change their password in an LDAP directory. This release appears to address an issue with detecting the browser language.
