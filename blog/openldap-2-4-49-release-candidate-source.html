  The <a href="https://www.openldap.org/" target="_blank">OpenLDAP</a> project has <a href="https://www.openldap.org/lists/openldap-technical/202001/msg00059.html" target="_blank">announced a release candidate</a> for their upcoming 2.4.49 release. Note that this release candidate appears to be source code only, so it is necessary to built it for yourself if you want to test it.

  While the announcement includes a list of the issues addressed in the upcoming release, the very brief descriptions provided do not offer much insight into what they actually entail. It appears to be a bugfix release, addressing issues with memory and file descriptor leaks, database interaction, password policy processing, schema handling, and control processing.
