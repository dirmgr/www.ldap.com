  The <a href="https://www.pingidentity.com/en/platform/directory/directory-overview.html" target="_blank">Ping Identity Directory Server</a> provides a get password quality requirements extended operation that allows clients to programmatically retrieve the conditions that a new password must satisfy so that they can be displayed to the user, and so the client can potentially perform some client-side validation on a proposed password. Thereâ€™s also a password validation details control that makes it possible to see which requirements were satisfied on a password change attempt. I write about these features on my <a href="https://nawilson.com/2019/01/29/programmatically-retrieving-password-quality-requirements-in-the-ping-identity-directory-server/" target="_blank">personal blog</a>.
