  Two new versions of the <a href="http://directory.fedoraproject.org/" target="_blank">389 Directory Server</a> have been released. The <a href="http://directory.fedoraproject.org/docs/389ds/releases/release-1-4-0-17.html" target="_blank">1.4.0.17 release</a> and the <a href="http://directory.fedoraproject.org/docs/389ds/releases/release-1-3-8-9.html" target="_blank">1.3.8.9 release</a> both appear to include critical fixes that address security and stability, including potential crashes and denials of service. If you’re using the 389 Directory Server, then it’s probably a good idea to update it to the latest version.
