  The <a href="https://github.com/ltb-project" target="_blank">LDAP Tool Box</a> project provides a set of LDAP-related applications, administrative tools, and other utilities.  They have just released the <a href="https://github.com/ltb-project/openldap-initscript/releases/tag/v2.5" target="_blank">version 2.5</a> of their <a href="https://github.com/ltb-project/openldap-initscript" target="_blank">OpenLDAP init script</a> component, which can be used to ensure that an <a href="https://www.openldap.org/" target="_blank">OpenLDAP</a> server is started on system boot. Improvements in the 2.5 release include systemd support and a fix to an issue that could occur when invoking a command with the su utility on a system that has a login banner.
