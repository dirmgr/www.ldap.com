  The <a href="https://github.com/ltb-project" target="_blank">LDAP Tool Box</a> project offers a number of tools, scripts, and other niceties for working with LDAP. They have <a href="https://github.com/ltb-project/openldap-rpm/releases/tag/v2.5.11" target="_blank">announced</a> the release of <a href="https://ltb-project.org/download.html#packages_for_red_hatcentos" target="_blank">OpenLDAP 2.5.11 RPMs for Red Hat and CentOS</a>. OpenLDAP version 2.5.11 is essentially the same as OpenLDAP version 2.5.10 but with a build problem fixed, so you can see the <a href="https://ldap.com/2022/01/20/openldap-2-6-1-and-2-5-10/" target="_blank">OpenLDAP 2.6.1 and 2.5.10</a> release announcement to see what has changed.
