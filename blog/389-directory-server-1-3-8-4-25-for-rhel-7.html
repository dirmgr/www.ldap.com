  <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/linux-platforms/enterprise-linux" target="_blank">Red Hat Enterprise Linux</a> version 7 has updated its packages for the <a href="https://directory.fedoraproject.org/" target="_blank">389 Directory Server</a> to version 1.3.8.4-25.1. According to a <a href="https://www.redhat.com/archives/rhsa-announce/2019-July/msg00063.html" target="_blank">security advisory</a>, this release addresses two security issues, including the potential for malicious TLS-based clients to make the server unresponsive, and the potential to crash the server when attempting to bind as a nonexistent user with a PAM plugin in place.
