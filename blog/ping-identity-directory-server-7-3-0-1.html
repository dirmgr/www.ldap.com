  The <a href="https://www.pingidentity.com/en/platform/directory/directory-overview.html" target="_blank">Ping Identity Directory Server</a> version 7.3.0.1 has been released. Because of an unfortunate glitch in the way that the documentation was generated for this version, updated release notes are not available on the website but are included with the product download. However, you can find a list of the included changes on <a href="https://nawilson.com/2019/09/12/ping-identity-directory-server-7-3-0-1/" target="_blank">my personal blog</a>.
