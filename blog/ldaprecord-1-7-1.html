<p>
  <a href="https://ldaprecord.com/" target="_blank">LdapRecord</a> aims to provide a simple way to interact with LDAP entries using PHP. The project has just released <a href="https://github.com/DirectoryTree/LdapRecord/releases/tag/v1.7.1" target="_blank">version 1.7.1</a>, which appears to include the following changes since the 1.6.0 version that I previously reported on:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Rolled back a previous change preventing setting empty option values, as it could cause problems in some cases (version 1.6.1)</li>
  <li>Add support for comparing DNs (version 1.7.0)</li>
  <li>When updating an attribute, prefer adding and removing individual values to replacing the entire set of values (version 1.7.1)</li>
</ul>
