<p>
Two new versions of the <a href="http://directory.fedoraproject.org/" target="_blank">389 Directory Server</a> have been released.
</p>

<p>
  The <a href="http://directory.fedoraproject.org/docs/389ds/releases/release-1-4-0-13.html" target="_blank">1.4.0.13 release</a> looks like the more significant of the two, adding support for SASL authentication in the CLI and other user interface, and ensuring that certain filesystem directories get created at startup, in addition to backing out a security fix introduced in the recent <a href="http://directory.fedoraproject.org/docs/389ds/releases/release-1-4-0-12.html" target="_blank">1.4.0.12 release</a> that deals with unhashed passwords after it created an issue with FreeIPA.
</p>

<p>
  The <a href="http://directory.fedoraproject.org/docs/389ds/releases/release-1-3-8-6.html" target="_blank">1.3.8.6 release</a> is smaller and only seems to be an update to the recent <a href="http://directory.fedoraproject.org/docs/389ds/releases/release-1-3-8-5.html" target="_blank">1.3.8.5 release</a> that backs out the same security fix that was reverted in the 1.4.0.13 release.
