  <a href="https://github.com/Adldap2/Adldap2" target="_blank">Adldap2</a> is a PHP package that provides LDAP authentication and directory management tools. The project has just released <a href="https://github.com/Adldap2/Adldap2/releases/tag/v10.2.0" target="_blank">version 10.2.0</a>, which fixes an issue that could yield different results across different types of directory servers, improved support for user account control on Active Directory, and made it easier to interact with the Active Directory userPrincipalName attribute.
