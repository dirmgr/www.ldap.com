  <a href="https://github.com/ldapjs/node-ldapjs" target="_blank">LDAPjs</a> is a JavaScript library that provides LDAP protocol support for the Node.js environment. The project has just released <a href="https://github.com/ldapjs/node-ldapjs/releases/tag/v3.0.1" target="_blank">version 3.0.1</a>, and the most significant change in this release seems to be a fix that allows alternative names for search scopes.
