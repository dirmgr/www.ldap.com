  <a href="https://symas.com/" target="_blank">Symas</a> has just released a new product: Directory Traffic Manager (DTM). It’s an LDAP proxy server that provides high availability and load balancing for LDAP directory servers (although it sounds like they’ve only tested it against OpenLDAP servers). For more information, see the <a href="https://symas.com/better-management-for-directory-ldap-traffic/" target="_blank">release announcement</a>.
