<p>
  The <a href="https://www.pingidentity.com/en/platform/directory/directory-overview.html" target="_blank">Ping Identity Directory Server</a> version 7.2.1.0 has been released. It is primarily a bugfix release (addressing issues in pass-through authentication, LDIF export of encrypted data, automatic naming of entries with the entryUUID attribute, among areas). However, the 7.2.1.0 release of the Data Synchronization Server does introduce bidirectional synchronization with the PingOne for Customers hosted directory service. I have written about this release in more detail on my <a href="https://nawilson.com/2019/04/12/ping-identity-directory-server-7-2-1-0/" target="_blank">personal blog</a>.
